# StudentsOnboarding


## Prerequisites

Before serving the project, you need to have Node version 8.9 and npm 5.5.1 or higher on your system. You can download the latest version of Node for your operating system on Node's official site.

If you already have Node and npm installed, verify their version by running:


$ node -v # => displays the node version
$ npm -v # => displays npm version

Once you have Node installed, you can use the npm command to install TypeScript:

$ npm install -g typescript
You don’t technically need TypeScript, but it’s highly recommended by the Angular team, so I recommend you install it to make working with Angular as comfortable as possible.

Now that you have Node, npm and TypeScript installed, you can install the angular cli by running:

$ npm install -g @angular/cli

## Installing
You can install the projects dependencies by running

$ npm install
